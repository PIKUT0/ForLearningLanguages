# ForLearningLanguages
This repo is created to continue learning programming instead of playing CS:GO or other games cuz need money to upgrade my Arknights account :D 
This repo will be updated over time as I brush up on my knowledge. I still have a lot work to do, so Ill add them here such as secondary files: olympiads, school project, Books I'm reading at the moment (Programming + Not programming). It take's time. But I already programming and haven't used github for over 4 years (C++) :D 11'th grade anyway.
